Big Steps : 
    Viewer
    Physics Calculator (+ file generator)
    Object class

Viewer:
    takes multiple files and outputs a visual
    file 1 : our cube's movement
    file 2 : landscape (stuff that doesn't move)
    file 3 : info like initial values

Physics Calculator:
    gets multiple parameters as input and generates the 3 files as output

Object Class:
    gets the info to generate our moving object, by default a square i guess

all objects will have an assigned nb which corresponds to their idx in a list given inside calculator which contains all objects
all objects should have a calculator object that corresponds to the same calculator

to check hitbox intersection : 

check shape for concaveness and seperate it into as many convexe subshapes as necessary
